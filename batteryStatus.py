This script is for the sole purpose of monitoring the battery in the
instrument. This is both a voltage based SoC measurement and a Coulomb counter.
Both are needed because although Coulomb counting is good for metering the energy
used by the battery, it cannot measure the charge currenly present in the battery.
For this, it needs to infer on the initial state of charge on a corrlation between
SoC and voltage across the battery. Coulomb counting is done by measuring the voltage
across a shunt resistor and integrating V/R over time.

This script should be called as a subprocess by the main python function
